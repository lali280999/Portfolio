# 🚀 Lalith Athithya – Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal resume website.  
It is a lightweight, responsive, single-page HTML website that showcases my experience, projects, skills, and contact details.

The website is built using **pure HTML + CSS** (no frameworks required) and is fully optimized to run on GitHub Pages or any static hosting platform.
